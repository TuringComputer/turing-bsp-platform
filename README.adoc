= Turing Computer Yocto BSP

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

[source,console]
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir turing-bsp
$: cd turing-bsp
$: repo init -u https://github.com/TuringComputer/turing-bsp-platform -b jethro
$: repo sync
$: repo start jethro --all

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

To start a simple image build:

[source,console]
$: source ./setup-environment build
$: bitbake turing-image-minimal

For QT5 support:

[source,console]
$: source ./setup-environment build
$: bitbake turing-image-qt5

You can use any directory to host your build.

It is recommended to have around 100GB free space to build the full images.

The source code is checked out at `turing-bsp/sources`.
