= Turing Computer Yocto BSP

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

[source,console]
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir turing-bsp
$: cd turing-bsp
$: repo init -u https://github.com/TuringComputer/turing-bsp-platform -b morty
$: repo sync
$: repo start morty --all

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

To start a simple image build:

[source,console]
$: MACHINE=imx6x-turing-smart DISTRO=fslc-xwayland
$: source ./setup-environment build
$: bitbake turing-image-minimal

You can use any directory to host your build.

It is recommended to have around 100GB free space to build the full images.

The source code is checked out at `turing-bsp/sources`.
